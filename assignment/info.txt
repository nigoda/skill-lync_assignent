Question

PROJECT:

Get an integer ‘N’ and an integer array ‘a’ of ‘N’ elements from the user.
Decrease the elements of the array multiple times to make the array non decreasing.
In all such possible non decreasing ordered array, print the sum of elements of that array that have the maximum sum.
 NOTE:

 A non decreasing array is an array in which every element is either equal or greater than the previous element.

 T- denotes the number of test cases. It specifies the number of times to run the solve function on a different set of inputs. 

 

Example:1

T=1, N=2, a={5,4}

 

Decreasing the first element of the array by 1.

a={4,4}. Therefore the sum is 4+4 = 8.

 

Example:2

T=1, N=5, a={1,5,2,3,4}

 

Decreasing the second element 3 times,

a={1,2,2,3,4}.

 

Now the array is non decreasing. 

Therefore the answer is 1+2+2+3+4=12.

 

Example:3

T=1, N=5, a={5,4,3,2,1}

 

Answer is 1+1+1+1+1=5
